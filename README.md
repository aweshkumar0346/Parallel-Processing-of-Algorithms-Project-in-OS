# Parallel-Processing-of-Algorithms-in-OS
This project endeavors to compare the efficiency of three programming techniques—Serial, OpenMP, and Multi-threading (pthreads)—by implementing them on three sorting algorithms: Binary-Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Cocktail Sort. While Serial denotes sequential programming, OpenMP and pthreads facilitate parallel execution. The primary objective is to identify the most efficient technique by measuring sorting times. This involves running programs with arrays of unsorted elements and recording sorting times using a timer.

Through this project, we seek to gain insights into the performance differences among these programming techniques. Preliminary observations suggest that the efficiency of each technique may be influenced by the size of the data. Sequential programming may demonstrate superior performance with smaller datasets, while parallel programming techniques might excel with larger datasets. Furthermore, variations in CPU burst time are anticipated, with sequential programming potentially consuming more CPU resources compared to parallel approaches, depending on the algorithms employed.

By systematically evaluating these techniques across various sorting algorithms and dataset sizes, this project aims to provide practical guidance on selecting the optimal programming technique for specific computational tasks. Ultimately, the findings of this study could contribute to enhancing our understanding of the trade-offs between sequential and parallel programming paradigms, aiding developers in making informed decisions regarding program optimization and resource allocation.
